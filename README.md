# Buffer_Overflow

Hi these are the scripts to help you do a buffer overflow attack if you want to use them you must know what you have to do.

A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. 
As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations. ... Buffer overflows can affect all types of software.
